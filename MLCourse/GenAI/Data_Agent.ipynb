May I ask a question of a... personal nature, sir? Why have I not been assigned to command a ship in the fleet? You have commented on the lack of senior officers available for this mission. I believe that my twenty-six years of Starfleet service qualify me for such a post.

Computer, where are the captain and Commander Riker? Curious. The captain is usually the last to leave. I hope we are the last. No. Are they not here on the Starbase? We have to beam back and get them. Which is the nearest Starfleet vessel? I know the Trieste. Too small, too slow. Where are the Bynars? Then they are obviously still aboard. Another Starfleet vessel must be sent to intercept the Enterprise at Bynaus. They might be taking the ship to their home planet. It is the best place for us to start. Do you think I am responsible?

It is a ship of exploration. My orders are to escort you to the Observation Lounge. We will proceed from there. Your sister never spoke of you. It is surprising to me. Tasha and I spent much time together in the course of our duties. We had a considerable number of conversations. Only to say that she was lucky to have escaped.

Sir, the purpose of this gathering has eluded me. My thoughts are not for Tasha, but for myself. I keep thinking how empty it will feel without her presence. I missed the point.
